= Introduction
In computatinal data analysis, accurate data visualization is essential for analysing complex structures.
This is of particular interest in the field of fusion physics, where plasmas are confined by strong magnetic fields inside so called _tokamaks_.
These plasmas often form fine and intricate structures.
Because of that, clear and accurate visual representations of such structures play a crucial role in understanding and validating plasma phenomena.

As its very costly to study plasma behavior through experiments in tokamak fusion reactors, simulation programs like the _Gyrokinetic Workshop_ (GKW) have been developed.
