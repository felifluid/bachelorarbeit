= Conclusion

// TODO:

The aim of this thesis was to look into and fix numerical artifacts, that occurred in some visualizations created by the previous ToPoVis code.
This goal was achieved, by adding the option to interpolate the low resolution simulation data to the code.
Interpolation results were validated by checking them against computationally intensive high resolution simulations.

// makes it possible to save a lot on expensive computations as grid upscaling through interpolation works near flawless.
